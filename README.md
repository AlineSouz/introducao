# Have Mercy :dancer:

### Chloe Bailey 

_Murda on the beat, so it's not nice
Booty so big (work!) Lord, have mercy (work!)_

Why I keep bossing like I do?
Why I keep flossing like I do?
Why I keep saucing like I do?
Why it keep costing like it do?
All this a- up in my jeans
You can't get up in between
You tryna get a piece of me
I can teach you a couple things (Lord, have mercy, work!)

Boy, you looking at me like I ain't give you no choice
If I count to three, bet you be on your knees
You wrapped 'round my hand like a Cartier, oh-oh
